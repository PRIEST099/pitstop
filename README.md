## Inspiration


**PITSTOP** was born from the realization that many car owners face recurring issues with vehicle maintenance but struggle to keep track of services and schedules. Seeing a gap in the market for a comprehensive, user-friendly platform, I was inspired to create PitStop. This platform is designed to efficiently manage all vehicle-related services, offering a holistic approach to tracking maintenance histories, scheduling appointments, and providing essential car care tips. As the sole creator, I am dedicated to making car maintenance hassle-free and invite you to join me on this journey towards smarter, simpler car care.

This project is also my Portfolio Project for Holberton School, showcasing my skills in web development and design.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PRIEST099/pitstop.git
   ```


2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd pitstop
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
   

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Set up the database:

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

6. Run the application:


   ‚ö†Ô∏èBut first you will have to install all the dependeencies used in this application

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install --force-reinstall itsdangerous==2.0.1
   ```
   And you will have to create a config file in the project directory that holds all the sensitive information as follows:

   ```bash
   touch config.py
   ```

   And then fill in the following information in the configuration file
   ```python
   class Config():
       SECRET_KEY = 'your secret key here' # üìí You can create you app secret key using Bcrypt
       SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///database-name.db'
       SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False

       # Email service configuration
       MAIL_SERVER = 'smtp.gmail.com'
       MAIL_PORT = 587
       MAIL_USE_TLS = True
       MAIL_USE_SSL = False
       MAIL_USERNAME = 'your email here'
       MAIL_PASSWORD = 'app password here'

       # SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA
       PHONE_NUMBER = 'phone number with country code'
       NONEXISTENT_EMAIL = 'some@email.here'
    
       # DEVELOPMENT CONFIGURATIONS
       VONAGE_KEY = 'vonage key'
       VONAGE_SECRET = 'vonage secret'
       VONAGE_PHONE_NUMBER = 'PHONE NUMBER WITH VONAGE API CONFIGURED ON THEIR DASHBOARD'
   ```


   With these configurations, I hope that now you are able to start the app with:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_DEBUG=1
   flask run
   ```
   üìí if you encounter any issues with any of the above setup, you can contact me [here](mailto:ahadic044@gmail.com)
